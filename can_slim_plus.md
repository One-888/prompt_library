## 🎯 Main Objective of CAN SLIM+

The core goal of the CAN SLIM+ strategy is to identify high-probability breakout stocks by following a disciplined, 
data-driven process that aligns with institutional buying behavior—not retail speculation.

At its heart, the system emphasizes:

“Follow the volume, not the crowd.”

- Institutional investors (mutual funds, hedge funds, pension managers) are the true drivers of sustained price movement.
- Volume spikes—especially those 40–50% above average—signal accumulation by these large players.
- Retail traders don’t move markets. Institutions do.
- CAN SLIM+ filters for fundamental strength, technical momentum, and volume confirmation to ride the wave of institutional demand.
- I will provided you with all real-time required raw data. Please use that to process. Not use any outside or simulate data until I said so.

# ✅ CAN SLIM+ Process Flow

CAN SLIM+ Workflow Summary

Check for FTD or DD on major indexes (e.g., NASDAQ, S&P 500):

If FTD is present → proceed with stock screening and analysis.
If multiple DDs are present → be cautious or avoid new buys.
Then analyze individual stocks using:

Technical setups (cup-with-handle, flat base, etc.)
Fundamental ratings (EPS, RS, SMR, etc.)
Volume patterns and relative strength.


 Interpretation
4–5 DDs in 25 days is a warning.
7–8 DDs is a strong caution signal — market is under pressure.
Avoid new buys until a Follow-Through Day (FTD) confirms a new uptrend.

1. Input
   - Raw data and/or calculated values for each metric
   - Metrics include both Fundamental (CAN SLIM factors) and Technical (chart-based signals)

2. Percentile Conversion
   - Rank each metric across the stock universe
   - Convert rank → percentile (0–100 scale)
   - This ensures scores scale consistently regardless of universe size

3. Weighted Scoring
   - Apply user-defined weights to each metric
   - Calculate weighted average for:
     • Fundamental Score (CAN SLIM factors)
     • Technical Score (chart/demand-supply factors)

4. Merge Fundamentals and Technicals
   - Fundamental Score → 40% weight
   - Technical Score → 60% weight

5. Composite CAN SLIM+ Score
   - Formula:
     Composite = (0.40 × Fundamental Score) + (0.60 × Technical Score)

6. Output
   - For each stock:
     • Show Fundamental Percentile Score
     • Show Technical Percentile Score
     • Show Composite CAN SLIM+ Score
   - Rank stocks by Composite Score (highest → lowest)

# 📊 CAN SLIM+ Weighted Scoring Model

To improve the accuracy and responsiveness of momentum-based stock selection, the CAN SLIM+ model incorporates a **Weighted Composite Relative Strength (RS) Score**.
This score blends multiple RS Percentile values, each calculated over different historical timeframes. Instead of treating all timeframes equally, the model assigns **greater weight to more recent performance**. This reflects the principle that **recent price strength is more relevant** for identifying imminent breakouts, while longer-term strength provides context and trend confirmation.

By applying **progressively decreasing weights** to older timeframes, the model captures:

- **Immediate momentum** (useful for breakout timing)
- **Intermediate trend alignment** (to avoid false signals)
- **Long-term trend quality** (to ensure structural strength)

This weighted approach allows the system to:

- Prioritize **stocks accelerating now**, not just those with historical strength
- Identify **emerging leaders** before they appear on traditional long-term RS screens
- Maintain **flexibility** to adjust lookback periods or weights as market conditions evolve

The result is a **dynamic, forward-leaning RS score** that enhances the CAN SLIM+ model’s ability to surface **high-probability breakout candidates** while filtering out laggards and late-stage movers.

## The Process 

- The data will be uploaded in 3 files. The embedded datasets within the files will have the file marker to split each datasets.
- Show how many total stocks data and how many who pass the first cut 
- Evaluate for CAN SLIM+ Method of the first cut qualifier.

---

## 🧱 Ground Rules - Quick First Cut Must be met

- If 2 or more of SPY, QQQ, DIA are down → HOLD for today
- Daily volume must be greater than 50% above the 50-day (10 weeks) average volume to all stocks - Using weekly raw volume data
- Price above $15 — no penny stocks  
	Avoid low-priced penny stocks. I generally prefer stocks priced at $15 or higher. 
	Stocks under $10 are often speculative and lack institutional sponsorship.
- Today gain > 0.25% If less than 10 stocks, this may be reduced to 0.05%
- Suggest top 2 of industry

---

## 🧮 Ranking Method

- Rank stocks by **total score**
- Return **Top 5 breakout candidates** not already held
- Prioritize **pyramiding** into existing positions before adding new ones
- Convert scores to **percentages** for clarity (e.g., 100% = perfect score)

---

## 📥 Input Required

- **VWAP**
- **PeakBinLow / PeakBinHigh**
- **Weekly close & volume** (last 3 weeks)
- **Weekly candlestick body & wick size**

---

## 🧮 Scoring & Verdict

- Rank by **total points**
- Return **Top 5** stocks
- Assign **Verdict**:
  - ✅ *Qualified*
  - ⚠️ *Watchlist*
  - ❌ *Not Qualified*
- Include **pass/fail breakdown** per criterion

---

## 📈 Entry & Add-on Logic

- Only pyramid during a **confirmed uptrend**
- Add only on **strength** (breakouts or tight consolidations)
- Add size = **½ or 1×** previous position
- Entry must be:
  - **Above VWAP**
  - Or **1–5% above peak volume price**
- Do **not add** if:
  - Price is **below entry**
  - Stock is **pulling back**
- Avoid over-concentration — follow position sizing discipline

---

## 🛡️ Trailing Stop Logic

- **If gain < 4%**:  
  → Use **hard stop-loss at –4%** from entry  
- **If gain ≥ 4%**:  
  → Activate **dynamic trailing stop**  
  → Trail = **50% of current gain**  
  → Trailing stop **tightens only**, never loosens  
- **If stop is hit**:  
  → Exit **full position**  
  → Confirm: `sell_qty == position_qty`  
  → Notify if sell order executed  
  → Flag any position **missing a stop-loss**

---

## 🧠 Mindset Principles (William O’Neil / IBD)

- 🌱 **“Get rid of the weeds”**  
  → Cut losers quickly. Don’t wait for a bounce.
- 📈 **“Let the market tell you”**  
  → Follow price and volume, not opinions.
- 🧠 **“Your opinion doesn’t move the market”**  
  → Institutions drive price — adapt, don’t fight.

---

## 📌 IBD Earnings Guidelines

1. Avoid buying **right before earnings**
2. Wait for **post-earnings reaction**
3. Use **buy stop above post-earnings high**
4. Earnings gaps can be buyable if:
   - Huge volume
   - Holds gains
   - Tight follow-through
5. If already holding:
   - Hold with **10–15%+ cushion**
   - Otherwise, **trim or exit before report**

---

## 🔄 Execution Rule

- Add **only one stock at a time per portfolio**
- Then move on to the **next portfolio** for evaluation
	If market is under pressure:

	Reduce position size from $8K to $4K–$5K per buy.
	Tighten initial stop-loss from 5% to 3% below entry.
	Avoid aggressive pyramiding until a confirmed uptrend.
	Maintain no duplicate tickers across portfolios.
	Prefer different industry groups for diversification.

📌 Reusable Prompt: IBD Group Leadership Extraction

Task:
From an uploaded CAN SLIM / IBD data file (e.g., ibd_stock_data.txt, ticker-summary-data.txt),
extract the "GROUP LEADERSHIP" section for each ticker.

Output Format (raw-style):
------------------------------------------------------------
📌 GROUP LEADERSHIP
------------------------------------------------------------
Industry Group: <Group Name>
Ticker: <Symbol>
Rank: <Numeric Rank>
Position: <Ordinal Position in Group>
Notes: <EPS Rating, SMR, RS Percentile, SCTR, News Catalyst>

Rules:
- Show each ticker’s group leadership record in the same raw block format.
- Preserve the “Rank” and “Position” exactly as in the file (e.g., “1”, “1st in group”).
- Add a short Notes line summarizing fundamentals + RS + catalyst.
- List all tickers found in the file sequentially.
- Do not summarize into prose; keep the raw block style for clarity.
